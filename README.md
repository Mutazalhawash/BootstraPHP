# BootstraPHP
A Bootstrap wrapper for PHP

(NEW) Built-In Bootswatch Theme Selector
Use init_bootswatch_stylesheet(stylename) instead of init_stylesheet() to load a Bootswatch theme!

This wrapper is still highly experimental. As of now, Navbars, Alerts, Badges, Pills, Buttons, Cards, List Groups (partially), Breadcrumbs, Jumbotrons and Spinners are implemented.
